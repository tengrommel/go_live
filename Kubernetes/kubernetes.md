# What is Kubernetes

- Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers
    - It lets you schedule containers on a cluster of machines
    - You can run multiple containers on one machine
    - You can run long running services(like web applications)
    - Kubernetes will manage the state of these containers
        - Can start the container on specific nodes
        - Will restart a container when it gets killed
        - Can move containers from one node to another node
        
 - Instead of just running a few docker containers on one host manually, Kubernetes is a platform that will manage the containers for you 
 
 - Kubernetes clusters can start with one node until thousands of nodes

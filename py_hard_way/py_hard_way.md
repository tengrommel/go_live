# Results Vs. Components

- Two Ways To Start
- Results: Screens, Automated Tests, Documentation
- Components: Modules, Functions, Libraries
- For Beginners I Recommend Results First

# Project 1:find
> Problem: A command line tool to find all files in the current directory that match a regular expression pattern.

This is the find unix tool.

## Get warmed up with a quick hack. IT'S ALRIGHT IF IT SUCKS!

1. Start with a tests/find_test.sh as a simple test of expected results.
2. Write English comments describing what is should do.
3. Research online what can do that.
4. Fill in the comments with code and rerun the .sh to test.
5. Keep running the tests to make it work right.
6. Write more tests.

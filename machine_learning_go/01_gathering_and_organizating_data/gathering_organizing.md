# Gathering and Organizing Data
> Polls have shown that 90% or more of a data scientist's time is spent gathering data, organizing it, and cleaning it, 
not traning/tuning their sophisticated machine learning model. 

Not all types of data are appropriate when using certain types of models.
> For example, certain models do not perform well when we have high-dimensional data (for example, text data), and other 
models assume that variables are normally distributed, which is definitely not always the case. Thus, we must take care 
in gathering data that fits our use case and make sure that we understand how our data and models will interact.

Another reason why gathering and organizing data consumes so much of a data scientist's time is that data is often messy and hard to aggregate.

# Handling data - Gopher style
> In comparison to many other languages that are used for data science/analysis, 
Go provides a very strong foundation for data manipulation and parsing.
